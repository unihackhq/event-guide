## What is a mentor?

Mentors give advice and constructive feedback to student teams on their prototype -
to make them better and have them potentially win the competition.

This includes, but not limited to:

  - Feedback on the idea itself
  - UX testing
  - Technical suggestions and queries (e.g. how do I use this API or service)
  - Being a beta tester

## First Things First

Most people will already have an idea before the competition. Make sure you focus
on "sanity checking" the idea (i.e. does it make any sense).

If they don't have an idea, try to stimulate discussion on some ideas. Try having
them think of things that annoy them or want to improve. Guide the discussion and
**try not to enforce** an idea onto a team.

## Remember, remember!

- Only offer what you know. Feel free to refer to another mentor if you think they
  are better suited for a question.

- You are not a participant. Do not contribute to the app's code. Reference examples
  instead.

- Not all participants will ask questions. We will encourage people to go and use
  mentors, but also feel free to roam around and ask what they are doing, and go
  from there.

- Be available to everyone, not just to one particular team.

- If you are planning to group up, be in groups of two.
