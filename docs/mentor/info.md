## Arrival

All mentors and recruiters should aim to arrive between 8:30am and 10:00am on Saturday
July 30. This allows us to get you registered and collect some cool swag from
our sponsors.

Gold and Platinum sponsors will also have a table at the careers fair. Please allow for
time to set up your table on the day.

## Slack
This year, we are also introducing Slack to all mentors and recruiters. This will allow the organisers to communicate to all attendees, and allow you to have a way to communicate with teams. There will be four channels open to the public:

-	&#35;general: used by the organisers to update all attendees
-	&#35;random: open to all for random chat
-	&#35;request-a-mentor: for all mentor requests or questions
-	&#35;qanda: questions to the organisers

All attendees should have received a Slack invite to the email account they used to register for UNIHACK 2016. If you did not receive an invite, ask one of the sponsorship representatives on the day and they can add you to the Slack channel.

You can find the UNIHACK 2016 Slack at [unihackmelbourne.slack.com](unihackmelbourne.slack.com)

## Smoking and Alcohol

The event and the venue has a no smoking policy. This applies to cigarettes, pipes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and vaporisers, and any method of consuming tobacco.

The University of Melbourne also has a no-smoking policy. This means that you will not be allowed to smoke outside the venue, on university grounds, or any place where it is marked "No Smoking". If you are caught smoking in these areas, you will be politely reminded about the no-smoking policy.

The event is a non-alcoholic event. Any alcoholic drinks will be confiscated by volunteers and/or the organisers. You will also be refused entry and/or asked to leave the venue if you are under the influence of alcohol.

## Social Media and Photography

We strongly encourage everyone to post messages and images on social media
during UNIHACK 2016. We ask that you use the hashtag #UNIHACK2016. Please
respect peopleâ€™s wishes if they do not wish to be photograph.
