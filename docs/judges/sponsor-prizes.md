Some companies have opted to have a custom prize at UNIHACK this year - either
to showcase their API or to set a challenge.

The company (not UNIHACK, with a few exceptions) is responsible for setting the
criteria or challenge (e.g. you must use this API, app must follow a certain
theme, etc). The company will also need to provide a company representative to
judge the entries at Presentation Day on your behalf, and provide the prizes
yourselves **at your own cost**.

As with all prizes, you will be able to announce the winner with all the other
winners at the end of Presentation Day.

## On Presentation Day

Judges for all custom prizes will have access to the Judges Only portion of
Presentation Day, from 1:30pm on Sunday.

Before the event, we will give a list of teams that have met the criteria - as
set out by the company.
