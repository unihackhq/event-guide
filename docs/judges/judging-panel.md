In order to decide the winner of the hackathon, UNIHACK has asked seven well-respected
members of the industry to judge all entries.

Unlike most hackathons in Australia, UNIHACK adopts a 'science fair' format instead
of a pitch presentation. This allows all judges to have a hands-on demonstration of a
team's prototype. It also gives a judge more time to ask questions.

This year, we are enforcing a time limit. Judges will have four minutes with each team.
This is to ensure that the judges will see all the teams *and* have enough time to
make a decision. Each judge will have a timekeeper that will ensure judges keep to the
time limit.

In addition, judges will have access to all the teams one hour before the public see
the teams' prototypes on Sunday. Given the number of teams, we expect that judges should see
at least half of the teams before the doors open to the general public.

## Schedule

Judges should aim to arrive at the [venue](../event/venue.md) at 1:00pm on Sunday July 30.

## Judging Criteria

The UNIHACK Judging Panel will determine all entries based on the following
criteria:

**Originality**  
Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app? Does it do
something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?

**Technical Difficulty**  
Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on
an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building it?

**Polish and Design**  
Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does it
work as the creators say? Is it well designed? Our judges will see and/or want
to use your prototype - so make sure it works!

**Usefulness**  
Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfil
a real need that people have? While you are not required to prepare a business
plan, your app should have an audience identified.
