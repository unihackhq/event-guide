In order to decide the winner of the hackathon, UNIHACK has asked seven
well-respected members of the industry to judge all entries.

Unlike most hackathons in Australia, UNIHACK adopts a 'science fair' format
instead of a pitch presentation. This allows all judges to have a hands-on
demonstration of a team's prototype. It also gives a judge more time to ask
questions.

This year, we are enforcing a time limit. Judges will have four minutes with
each team. This is to ensure that the judges will see all the teams *and* have
enough time to make a decision. Each judge will have a timekeeper that will
ensure judges keep to the time limit.

We have asked teams to ensure their pitch is within two minutes, giving you two
minutes of questions.

In addition, judges will have access to all the teams one hour before the public
see the teams' prototypes on Sunday. Given the number of teams, we expect that
judges should see at least half of the teams before the doors open to the
general public.

## Prizes to be decided by Judging Panel

The Judging Panel will decide the following prizes:

- Major Prize (first, second and third)
- Best Design
- Most Creative Idea

Judges will be placed in a room to determine who will be first, second and third.
The decision does not need to be unanimous. All teams will also have a submission
on our [DevPost](http://unihack2016.devpost.com) which will be available to all
judges.

The Best Design and Most Creative Idea prizes will be simply determined by whoever
receives the most points in *Polish and Design* and *Originality* respectively.

## Judging Criteria

The UNIHACK Judging Panel will determine all entries based on the following
criteria:

**Originality**  
Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app? Does it do
something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?

**Technical Difficulty**  
Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick on
an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building it?

**Polish and Design**  
Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does it
work as the creators say? Is it well designed? Our judges will see and/or want
to use your prototype - so make sure it works!

**Usefulness**  
Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfil
a real need that people have? While you are not required to prepare a business
plan, your app should have an audience identified.
