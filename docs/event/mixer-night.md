![Mixer Night](../img/mixernight-head.jpg)

This year, for the first time, we are introducing a Mixer Night on July 26.

The Mixer Night will feature industry experts presenting talks that will prep you before the main event and ensure you and your team are ready. Some mentors will make an appearance to help you fine-tune your idea.

This will also be an opportunity for people to find team members.
